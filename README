The purpose of this project is to simulate a transfer of a cryptographic key
through quantum system between two corresponding common-
also called Alice and Bob . We will then show how the presence of a
spy, traditionally called Eve, can be very easily detected. A
comparison of different methods of reconciliation is to be implemented.
